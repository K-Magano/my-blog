Just three months into my first "Hello World" code to a whole HTML and CS project.

This was only the beginning of a journey that would have sleepless nights and early morning, I would site at my computer for hours slowly typing away and wrapping my head around CSS and HTML syntax.

It been months and I have since leant about frameworks and libraries to help ease the headache of centring a div.

Never the less, making sites look pretty and user friendly remains one of my favorite things to do. This was the beginning of an Impactful and inspiring journey into software development at Royal Impact, in Phokeng

An HTML and CSS Resume as a first project at CodeSpace Academy and my code coach Naeem Witbooi said it looked Youtube inspired ðŸ˜Ž . I had so much fun.
